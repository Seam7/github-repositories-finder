# Github repositories finder üë®‚Äç‚úàÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è

## Overview

## How to run it
### Pre-requisites: 
1- node version 12 or higher
2- npm version 6.14.5 or higher
3- Cypress - This project uses version 6.8.0 so a newish version of their GUI should be ok
### To run the project:
1- Clone this project
2- In the project's directory run `npm install`
3- After `npm install` is done, in the same directory run `npm start`
### To run the tests:
1- Have the project running in another terminal session
2- Run `npm run cypress:open`
3- When the GUI opens, click on `search.spec.js` under `INTEGRATION TESTS`
- If you have any troubles running cypress, refer to the `npm run cypress:open` section inside Available Scripts of this README

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run cypress:open`

Launches the cypress test runner, opening the cypress GUI. Make sure the project‚Äôs local server is running beforehand

- Be careful when running the tests as the GitHub public API has limited request per hour. Refer to this page for more information https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/rate-limits-for-github-apps#user-to-server-requests.

To run cypress make sure you have it installed correctly following [this guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
